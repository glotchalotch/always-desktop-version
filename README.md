# Always Desktop Version
Have you ever been linked to the mobile versions of Twitter and Wikipedia and been annoyed at the lack of redirection?

Well, this is an extension that fixes that for you. With this extension, m.wikipedia.org and mobile.twitter.com will redirect to their desktop versions. I might add more sites in the future if anyone wants that or if I find another site that annoys me. I might port it to Chrome later as well.

You can also disable either one of the site redirects by going to the extension's options page.

I also don't have any experience with extensions, so if you want to contribute, go ahead!
